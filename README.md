# Stripe React Native SDK

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@stripe/stripe-react-native.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/stripe-react-native)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/stripe/stripe-react-native)](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/blob/master/LICENSE)

The Stripe React Native SDK allows you to build delightful payment experiences in your native Android and iOS apps using React Native. We provide powerful and customizable UI screens and elements that can be used out-of-the-box to collect your users' payment details.

## Getting started

Get started with our [ðŸ“š integration guides](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native) and [example project](#run-the-example-app), or [ðŸ“˜ browse the SDK reference](https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native).

> Updating to a newer version of the SDK? See our [changelog](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features

**Simplified Security**: We make it simple for you to collect sensitive data such as credit card numbers and remain [PCI compliant](https://stripe.com/docs/security#pci-dss-guidelines). This means the sensitive data is sent directly to Stripe instead of passing through your server. For more information, see our [Integration Security Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/security).

**Apple Pay**: We provide a [seamless integration with Apple Pay](https://stripe.com/docs/apple-pay).

**Payment methods**: Accepting more [payment methods](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods/overview) helps your business expand its global reach and improve checkout conversion.

**SCA-Ready**: The SDK automatically performs native [3D Secure authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure) if needed to comply with [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) regulation in Europe.

**Native UI**: We provide native screens and elements to securely collect payment details on Android and iOS.

**PaymentSheet**: [Learn how to integrate](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment) PaymentSheet, our new pre-built payments UI for mobile apps. PaymentSheet lets you accept cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and much more out of the box and also supports saving & reusing payment methods. PaymentSheet currently accepts the following payment methods: Card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, SEPA Debit, Bancontact, iDEAL, and Sofort.

#### Recommended usage

If you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. For all other scenarios you can use this SDK to process payments via Stripe.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @stripe/stripe-react-native
or
npm install @stripe/stripe-react-native
```

### Expo

> [Find Expo's full documentation here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/stripe/).

Each Expo SDK version requires a specific `stripe-react-native` version. See the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for a mapping of versions. To install the correct version for your Expo SDK version run:

```sh
expo install @stripe/stripe-react-native
```

Next, add:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "plugins": [
      [
        "@stripe/stripe-react-native",
        {
          "merchantIdentifier": string | string [],
          "enableGooglePay": boolean
        }
      ]
    ],
  }
}
```

to your `app.json` file, where `merchantIdentifier` is the Apple merchant ID obtained [here](https://stripe.com/docs/apple-pay?platform=react-native). Otherwise, Apple Pay will not work as expected. If you have multiple `merchantIdentifier`s, you can set them in an array.

### Requirements

#### Android

- Android 5.0 (API level 21) and above
- Android gradle plugin 4.x and above

_Components_

In order to use [CardForm](https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native/api-reference/modules.html#CardForm) component, you need to install and configure [Material Components theme](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#4-change-your-app-theme-to-inherit-from-a-material-components-theme) in your app.

1. Add below dependency to your `app/build.gradle` file with specified version

```tsx
implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:<version>'
```

2. Set appropriate style in your `styles.xml` file

```tsx
<style name="Theme.MyApp" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight">
    <!-- ... -->
</style>
```

#### iOS

Compatible with apps targeting iOS 11 or above.

The SDK uses TypeScript features available in Babel version `7.9.0` and above.
Alternatively use the `plugin-transform-typescript` plugin in your project.

You'll need to run `pod install` in your `ios` directory to install the native dependencies.

## Usage example

```tsx
// App.ts
import { StripeProvider } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';

function App() {
  return (
    <StripeProvider
      publishableKey={publishableKey}
      merchantIdentifier="merchant.identifier"
    >
      <PaymentScreen />
    </StripeProvider>
  );
}

// PaymentScreen.ts
import { CardField, useStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';

export default function PaymentScreen() {
  const { confirmPayment } = useStripe();

  return (
    <CardField
      postalCodeEnabled={true}
      placeholder={{
        number: '4242 4242 4242 4242',
      }}
      cardStyle={{
        backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
        textColor: '#000000',
      }}
      style={{
        width: '100%',
        height: 50,
        marginVertical: 30,
      }}
      onCardChange={(cardDetails) => {
        console.log('cardDetails', cardDetails);
      }}
      onFocus={(focusedField) => {
        console.log('focusField', focusedField);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Stripe initialization

To initialize Stripe in your React Native app, use the `StripeProvider` component in the root component of your application, or use the `initStripe` method.

`StripeProvider` can accept `urlScheme`, `publishableKey`, `stripeAccountId`, `threeDSecureParams` and `merchantIdentifier` as props. Only `publishableKey` is required.

```tsx
import { StripeProvider } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';

function App() {
  const [publishableKey, setPublishableKey] = useState('');

  const fetchPublishableKey = async () => {
    const key = await fetchKey(); // fetch key from your server here
    setPublishableKey(key);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchPublishableKey();
  }, []);

  return (
    <StripeProvider
      publishableKey={publishableKey}
      merchantIdentifier="merchant.identifier"
    >
      // Your app code here
    </StripeProvider>
  );
}
```

or

```tsx
import { initStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';

function App() {
  // ...

  useEffect(() => {
    initStripe({
      publishableKey: publishableKey,
      merchantIdentifier: 'merchant.identifier',
    });
  }, []);
}
```

You can find more details about the `StripeProvider` component in the [API reference](https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native/api-reference/modules.html#stripeprovider).

##### Additional steps for webhook forwarding

Certain payment methods require a [webhook listener](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status#webhooks) to notify you of changes in the status. When developing locally, you can use the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) to forward webhook events to your local dev server.

- [Install the `stripe-cli`](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install)
- Run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook`
- The CLI will print a webhook secret (such as, `whsec_***`) to the console. Set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET to this value in your `example/.env` file.

## Testing

This library includes a built in mock file for Jest.
In order to use it, add the following code to the Jest setup file:

```tsx
import mock from '@stripe/stripe-react-native/jest/mock.js';

jest.mock('@stripe/stripe-react-native', () => mock);
```

To have a more control over the mocks, you can extend and override particular methods e.g.:

```tsx
const presentApplePayMock = jest.fn();

jest.mock('@stripe/stripe-react-native', () => ({
  ...mock,
  presentApplePay: presentApplePayMock,
}));
```

## Troubleshooting

### `Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64` on iOS

While building your iOS project, you may see a `Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64` error. This is caused by `react-native init` template configuration that is not fully compatible with Swift 5.1.

```
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "(extension in Foundation):__C.NSScanner.scanUpToString(Swift.String) -> Swift.String?", referenced from:
      static Stripe.STPPhoneNumberValidator.formattedRedactedPhoneNumber(for: Swift.String, forCountryCode: Swift.String?) -> Swift.String in libStripe.a(STPPhoneNumberValidator.o)
  "__swift_FORCE_LOAD_$_swiftUniformTypeIdentifiers", referenced from:
      __swift_FORCE_LOAD_$_swiftUniformTypeIdentifiers_$_Stripe in libStripe.a(PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController+Stripe_Blocks.o)
```

Follow these steps to resolve this:

- Open your project via Xcode, go to `project -> build settings`, find `library search paths` and remove all swift related entries such as:
  `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)` and `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift-5.0/$(PLATFORM_NAME)`.
- Create a new Swift file to the project (File > New > File > Swift), give it any name (e.g. `Fix.swift`) and create a bridging header when prompted by Xcode.

### `TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating '_NativeStripeSdk.default.initialise')` on Android

You might see error this whilst initializing the `StripeProvider` component with Expo. This is caused by using an older version of Expo before stripe-react-native was [officially supported](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/issues/3#issuecomment-846225534). Updating Expo Go from the stores (or locally on simulators installed with `expo install:client:[ios|android]`) should fix the problem.

If you're still having troubles, please [open an issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/issues/new/choose) or jump in our [developer chat](https://stripe.com/go/developer-chat).
