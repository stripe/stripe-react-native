/**
 * A transparent activity that is launched when the Payment Element requests the
 * `confirmCustomPaymentMethodCallback`.
 *
 * Its only purpose is to bring the app back to the foreground (the Stripe
 * SDK launches its own proxy activity which pauses the host React Native
 * activity). Having a React (transparent) activity on top ensures that React
 * Native can display UI elements such as `Alert` dialogs coming from
 * JavaScript.
 *
 * The activity uses a translucent theme to minimize visibility and is excluded
 * from recents, though it may still be briefly visible to the end-user during
 * certain operations.
