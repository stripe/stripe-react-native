# Contributing

We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Development workflow

To get started with the project, run `yarn bootstrap` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
yarn bootstrap
```

While developing, you can run the [example app](/example/) to test your changes.

To start the packager:

```sh
yarn example start
```

To run the example app on Android:

```sh
yarn example android
```

To run the example app on iOS:

```sh
yarn example ios
```

Make sure your code passes TypeScript and ESLint. Run the following to verify:

```sh
yarn typescript
yarn lint
```

To fix formatting errors, run the following:

```sh
yarn lint --fix
```

Remember to add tests for your change if possible. Run the unit tests by:

```sh
yarn test
```

To edit the Objective-C files, open `example/ios/StripeSdkExample.xcworkspace` in XCode and find the source files at `Pods > Development Pods > stripe-react-native`.

To edit the Kotlin files, open `example/android` in Android studio and find the source files at `reactnativestripesdk` under `Android`.

### Install library as local repository

To install local/private packages across local environment we recommend use [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) tool.

- Run `yalc publish` in `@stripe/stripe-react-native` package to publish all the files that should be published in remote NPM registry.
- Run `yalc add @stripe/stripe-react-native` in your dependent project, which will copy the current version from the store to your project's .yalc folder and inject a file:.yalc/@stripe/stripe-react-native into package.json.
- In your dependent project run `yarn install` and `cd ios && pod install`

### Commit message convention

We follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:

- `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix crash due to deprecated method.
- `feat`: new features, e.g. add new method to the module.
- `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.
- `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for the module..
- `test`: adding or updating tests, eg add integration tests using appium.
- `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change CI config.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.

### Linting

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting the code, and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter and tests pass when committing.

### Tests

We use [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium) for e2e testing.
Since we don't have configured CI yet we must remember to run tests locally for both platforms before merge pr's.
To to that you have to install and configure appium following its [documentation](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started.md).

Next, you have to specify emulator/simulator details in the config files.
To set it up on android, let's open `wdio.android.js/wdio.ios.js` files and edit `capabilities` section accordingly (platformVersion, deviceName, app).

As Appium uses chrome-driver on android to handle webviews interactions you must to specify chrome version which is installed on your emulator already.
In order to do that, edit .npmrc accordinly to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appium/appium-chromedriver/master/config/mapping.json mapping config.
e.g. when you have `71.0.3578` chrome version installed you must specify `2.46` version of chrome-driver.

1. run `yarn run-example-ios` / `yarn run-example-android` to build and open example app.
2. run `yarn test:ios` / `yarn test:android` to run e2e tests.

### Scripts

The `package.json` file contains various scripts for common tasks:

- `yarn bootstrap`: setup project by installing all dependencies and pods.
- `yarn typescript`: type-check files with TypeScript.
- `yarn lint`: lint files with ESLint.
- `yarn test`: run unit tests with Jest.
- `yarn example start`: start the Metro server for the example app.
- `yarn example android`: run the example app on Android.
- `yarn example ios`: run the example app on iOS.

When you're sending a pull request:

- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
- Verify that linters and tests are passing.
- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.
