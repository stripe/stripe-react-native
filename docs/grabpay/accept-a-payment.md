# GrabPay payments

Learn how to accept GrabPay, a common payment method in Southeast Asia.

## 1. Setup Stripe

The React Native SDK is open source and fully documented. Under the hood it uses native Android and iOS SDKs.

To install the SDK run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
yarn add stripe-react-native
or
npm install stripe-react-native
```

For iOS you will have to run `pod install` inside `ios` directory in order to install needed native dependencies. Android won't require any additional steps.

Configure the SDK with your Stripe [publishable key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys) so that it can make requests to the Stripe API. In order to do that use `StripeProvider` component in the root component of your application or `initStripe` method alternatively.

```tsx
import { StripeProvider } from 'stripe-react-native';

function App() {
  return (
    <StripeProvider publishableKey="pk_test_51Ho4m5A51v44wNexXNFEg0MSAjZUzllhhJwiFmAmJ4tzbvsvuEgcMCaPEkgK7RpXO1YI5okHP08IUfJ6YS7ulqzk00O2I0D1rT">
      // Your app code here
    </StripeProvider>
  );
}
```

## 2. Create a PaymentIntent

### Server side

Stripe uses a PaymentIntent object to represent your intent to collect payment from a customer, tracking your charge attempts and payment state changes throughout the process.

### Client side

On the client, request a PaymentIntent from your server and store its client secret.

```tsx
const fetchPaymentIntentClientSecret = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/create-payment-intent`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      currency: 'sgd',
      items: [{ id: 'id' }],
      payment_method_types: ['grabpay'],
    }),
  });
  const { clientSecret, error } = await response.json();

  return { clientSecret, error };
};
```

## 3. Collect billing details

In your app, collect the **optional** billing details from the customer, e.g. customer name.

```tsx
export default function GrabPayPaymentScreen() {
  const [name, setName] = useState();

  const handlePayPress = async () => {
    // ...
  };

  return (
    <Screen>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Name"
        onChange={(value) => setName(value.nativeEvent.text)}
      />
    </Screen>
  );
}
```

## 4. Submit the payment to Stripe

Retrieve the client secret from the PaymentIntent you created in step 2 and call `confirmPayment` method. This presents a webview where the customer can complete the payment on their bankâ€™s website or app. Afterwards, the promise will be resolved with the result of the payment.

```tsx
export default function GrabPayPaymentScreen() {
  const [name, setName] = useState();

  const handlePayPress = async () => {
    const billingDetails: PaymentMethodCreateParams.BillingDetails = {
      name,
    };
  };

  const { error, paymentIntent } = await confirmPayment(clientSecret, {
    type: 'GrabPay',
    billingDetails,
  });

  if (error) {
    Alert.alert(`Error code: ${error.code}`, error.message);
  } else if (paymentIntent) {
    Alert.alert(
      'Success',
      `The payment was confirmed successfully! currency: ${paymentIntent.currency}`
    );
  }

  return (
    <Screen>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Name"
        onChange={(value) => setName(value.nativeEvent.text)}
      />
    </Screen>
  );
}
```
