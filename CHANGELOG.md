- Fixed an issue on iOS where `canAddCardToWallet` would return `false` if the card had already been provisioned on a paired device like an Apple Watch, but had not yet been provisioned on the current device, and would also return `false` if the card had been provisioned on the current device, but not on a paired Apple Watch. [#1219](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1219)

[#1169](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1169)

## Fixes

### Breaking changes

- To comply with Google's [new branding guidelines for the Google Pay button](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/brand-guidelines), the `<GooglePayButton />` component's `type` prop now only accepts `standard` or `pay` (`pay_shadow`, `pay_dark`, `standard_shadow`, and `standard_dark` were all removed). It defaults to `standard`. [#1135](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1135)
- Your `compileSdkVersion` (in `android/build.gradle`) now must be at least 33. Changing your `compileSdkVersion` does not change runtime behavior.

## 0.18.1 - 2022-08-19

### Breaking changes

### New features

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where some promises on Android would never resolve when using React Native 0.65.x or under. [#1089](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1089).

## 0.18.0 - 2022-08-17

### Breaking changes

- Your `compileSdkVersion` (in `android/build.gradle`) now must be at least `32`. Changing your `compileSdkVersion` does not change runtime behavior.

### New features

- `confirmPayment` can now be called with _just_ a client secret (e.g. `await confirmPayment("payment-intent-id")`), in other words the payment method can be excluded. If the payment method is excluded, it is assumed by the SDK that you have attached the payment method on the server-side during payment intent creation. [#1084](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1084)
- Payment Sheet now supports Link on iOS. [#1086](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1086).

### Fixes

- Fixed a bug on Android where `collectBankAccountForPayment`, `collectBankAccountForSetup`, `collectBankAccountToken`, and `collectFinancialConnectionsAccounts` wouldn't work with Stripe Connect accounts. [#1086](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1086).
- Upgraded `stripe-ios` to 22.7.+ and `stripe-android` to 20.9.+.

## 0.17.0 - 2022-08-11

### Breaking changes

### New features

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue where Android apps could crash with the error `IllegalStateException: Cannot remove Fragment attached to a different FragmentManager`. [#1054](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1054)
- Bumped Gradle from 4.2.2 to 7.1.1. [#1058](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1058)

## 0.16.0 - 2022-07-22

### Breaking changes

- The `<GooglePayButton />` component no longer overrides the `type` to use the dark mode version when the device is in Dark Mode. If you set the `type` value, it will always be respected. If you don't set the `type` value, it will match the system's theme (`standard_shadow` when in Light Mode, and `standard_dark` when in Dark Mode). [#1051](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1051)

### New features

- Added support for `pay_dark` and `standard_dark` to the `<GooglePayButton />` component's `type` prop. This allows you to display the [dark Google Pay button](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/brand-guidelines). [#1051](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1051)
- Added support for `borderColor`, `borderRadius`, and `cursorColor` to `CardForm`'s `cardStyle` prop on iOS (already exists on Android). [#1048](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1048)

### Fixes

- Reduced the size of the `@stripe/stripe-react-native` by preventing unnecessary files from being published. [#1043](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1043)

## 0.15.0 - 2022-07-14

### Breaking changes

- [#1020](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1020) Changed some of fields for the `params` object that is supplied to `initPaymentSheet(params)`:
  - **Changed the `applePay` field**. Previously this field accepted a boolean, now it accepts an object of type `ApplePayParams`, which includes the `merchantCountryCode` field, and a new `paymentSummaryItems` field (see "New features" below).
  - **Changed the `googlePay` field**. Previously this field accepted a boolean, now it accepts an object of type `GooglePayParams`, which includes the `merchantCountryCode`, `currencyCode`, and `testEnv` fields.
  - Since the `merchantCountryCode` field now lives under the `applePay` and `googlePay` objects, it has been removed from the base `params` object.
  - Similarly, since the `currencyCode` and `testEnv` fields now live under the `googlePay` object, they have been removed from the base `params` object .
- [#1020](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1020) In `ApplePay.CartSummaryItem`:
  - Renamed `type` to `isPending`- (if you had `type: 'pending'`, replace it with `isPending: true`. if `type: 'final'`, either remove it or set `isPending: false`).
    - The same change was made to `ApplePay.ShippingMethod`: renamed `type` to `isPending`.
  - Added a **new** `paymentType` field. This field is **required**, and in all pre-existing cases where you created a `CartSummaryItem`, should be set to `paymentType: 'Immediate'` (support for types `Deferred` and `Recurring` wasn't available until this release).

### New features

- Added support for iOS 15 `paymentSummaryItems`: `PKDeferredPaymentSummaryItem` and `PKRecurringPaymentSummaryItem`.
- You can now specify Apple Pay line items to be displayed when paying with Apple Pay in PaymentSheet by providing `applePay.paymentSummaryItems` to the `initPaymentSheet` method. [#1020](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1020)
- Added support for Affirm (previously, Affirm was only available in the Payment Sheet). [1036](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1036)

### Fixes

- Fixed behavior of `CardField` and `CardForm` on Android to match that on iOS; postal code input no longer accepts characters that are never present in postal codes (anything besides 0-9, a-z, A-Z, hyphens, and whitespace). [#1027](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1027).
- Fixed an issue on older version of React Native where calling `collectBankAccountForSetup` or `collectBankAccountForPayment` and getting a `Canceled` result could cause a crash. [#1037](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1037)
- Fixed an issue where some Android builds would fail on the `lintVitalRelease` step. [#1038](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1038)

- Fixed an issue where Payment Sheet would cause crashes on Android if `merchantDisplayName` wasn't provided. [#1015](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1015)
- Fixed a bug on Android where a crash could occur if the PaymentSheet was canceled and opened again. [#1014](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/1014)
- Fixed an instance on iOS where `CardField`'s expiry date would remain marked as valid, even when it's invalid. [#1018](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/issues/1018)

## 0.13.1 - 2022-06-16 (ðŸ“Œ Expo SDK 46)

### Breaking changes

- Fixed an issue on Android where the `complete` field in the `onCardChange` callback would incorrectly be set to `true` even if the postal code wasn't filled out. [#989](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/989)
- Make `SetupIntent.lastSetupError` and `PaymentIntent.lastPaymentError` object shape consistent on iOS and Android.[#990](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/990)

- [#861](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/861) BREAKING: This library now supports iOS 12 and up, due to `stripe-ios` increasing the deployment target. If you would like to build for iOS 11, please continue to use `@stripe/stripe-react-native@0.5.0`.
  - To upgrade your iOS deployment target to 12.0, you can either do so in Xcode under your `Build Settings`, or by modifying `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in your `project.pbxproj` directly. You will also need to update your Podfile to target `:ios, '12.0'`.
- [#861](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/pull/861) Feat: Add support for ACHv2 payments **on iOS only**.

  - Deprecated `handleCardAction` in favor of `handleNextAction`. `handleNextAction` functions exactly the same, this is just a rename. `handleCardAction` will be removed in a future release.
